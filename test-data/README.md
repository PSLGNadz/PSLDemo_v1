# Sample Test Document

This is a placeholder file for document upload testing.

You should replace this with an actual image file (PNG, JPG) for your tests.

Recommended:
- Create a sample ID card image
- Keep file size small (< 1MB)
- Use common formats (PNG, JPG, PDF)
- Name it appropriately for the test context
